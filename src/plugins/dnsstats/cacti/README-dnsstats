1. INTRODUCTION
===============

The DNS statistics module comes with a script that can help you integrate
the module in a Cacti setup. This README files describes how to call the
script and how to configure your SNMP daemon such that the included Cacti
templates will work.

2. PREREQUISITES
================

The following prerequisites need to be met:

* You must have root privileges on the system on which you wish to install
  this plugin
* You must have a recent version of the SNMP daemon installed on your system
* You must install eemo including the DNS statistics plugin

3. INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING
=============================

By default, calling 'make install' in the main eemo source directory will
ensure that the script dnsstats_cacti.sh is installed in an appropriate
location (usually /usr/local/sbin). If it is not installed, you may install
it manually at a location of your choice.

Next, you should add a rule to the cron table for the root user. This rule
should invoke the dnsstats_cacti.sh script at regular intervals. The length
of the interval depends on your Cacti configuration and should correspond to
the Cacti polling interval (default: 5 minutes). The cron rule could look
like this (for 5 minute intervals, script installed in the default location):

*/5 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/dnsstats_cacti.sh

Finally, you should add the following line to your snmpd.conf configuration 
file:

extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.1076.101.101.109.111 dnsstats /bin/cat /var/local/eemo/eemo_dnsstats

In the example above, it is assumed that the DNS statistics are output to the
file /var/local/eemo/eemo_dnsstats.

4. USING THE TOOL
=================

Once you have installed and configured the tool as described in section 3,
you can start eemo and install the cron job. Wait the appropriate amount of
time and check that the statistics file is duely updated. If it is, you can
check if the SNMP data is available by invoking the following command:

$ snmpwalk -v2c -c <yourcommunity> <yourhostname> .1.3.6.1.4.1.1076.101.101.109.111

You should see the following entry in the list:

.1.3.6.1.4.1.1076.101.101.109.111.8.100.110.115.115.116.97.116.115

If you now install the Cacti template included in the distribution you
should be able to view DNS statistics gather by the eemo DNS statistics plugin
for your host.

5. GRAPH TEMPLATES FOR CACTI
============================

Graph templates for Cacti are included in the distribution in the form of XML
templates that you can import to Cacti.
